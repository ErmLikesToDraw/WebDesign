For just the second building block of the class, I am very happy with my progress! I think it has already come a long way since the first week, and I'm starting to really enjoy the satisfaction I get when my pieces of code come together. There are some things I still could not figure out, namely the bees near the top of the page. They were centered for a moment when I re-centered all of the other paragraphs, but when I changed the background color they unexplainably shifted to the left again. This will take more troubleshooting, but I at least know I can do it somehow. I could also only get some of the hexidecimal colors to work. I tried a number of different colors for the warmer colors, but it wouldn't register on the actual website. Not sure what was different about these hexidecimal colors compared to the background ones. Looking forward to the next few modules!
