## Incorporated Feedback

During the first week, I posted my original webpage for my classmates to see and critique. The general consensus was that the color choices were interesting and the layout was solid, but I needed to do a bit more to make it distinct and readable. A few suggestions included making the paragraph text bigger and to find some way to distinquish the subheading further from the background.

I fixed both of these issues by scaling up the text and changing the subheading to a color that stood out more from the background. I also added a lighter background around the paragraph text to set it apart even further. After the legibility was fixed, I added some extra details like quotes, pictures at the bottom and top, and a light border, inspired by my figma page but refined a bit more.
