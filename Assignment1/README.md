## Incorporated Feedback

During the first week, I posted my original webpage for my classmates to see and critique. The general consensus was that the color choices were interesting and the layout was solid, but I needed to do a bit more to make it distinct and readable. A few suggestions included making the paragraph text bigger and to find some way to distinquish the subheading further from the background.

I fixed both of these issues by scaling up the text and changing the subheading to a color that stood out more from the background. I also added a lighter background around the paragraph text to set it apart even further. After the legibility was fixed, I added some extra details like quotes, pictures at the bottom and top, and a light border, inspired by my figma page but refined a bit more. I did run into some issues though; I spent a very long time looking over my code and my style sheet and cannot figure out what is wrong with the quotes and the soccer balls at the bottom. This is something I will continue to workshop, but as of right now I am at a loss.
